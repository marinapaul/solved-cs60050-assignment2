<strong>The following has to be done using Bayesian learning (Naïve Bayes classifier): </strong>

<ul>

 <li>Randomly divide the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Apply the following:

  <ol>

   <li>Handle the missing values in both train and test set. [5]</li>

   <li>Encode categorical variables using appropriate encoding method (in-built function allowed). [5]</li>

   <li>After completing step (a) and (b), compute 5-fold cross validation on the training set</li>

  </ol></li>

</ul>

(normalisation of data is allowed, if required). Print the final test accuracy. [10]

<ul>

 <li>Apply PCA (select number of components by preserving 95% of total variance) on the processed data from step (1).

  <ol>

   <li>Plot the graph for PCA (in-built function allowed for PCA and visualisation). [20]</li>

   <li>Use the features extracted from PCA to train your model. Compute 5-fold cross validation on the training set (normalisation of data is allowed, if required). Print the final test accuracy. [10]</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Using the processed data from step (1), apply the following:

  <ol>

   <li>A feature value is considered as an outlier if its value is greater than mean + 3 x standard deviation. A sample having maximum such outlier features must be dropped. [5]</li>

   <li>Using the sequential backward selection method, remove features. [15]</li>

   <li>Print the final set of features formed. [5]</li>

   <li>Compute 5-fold cross validation on the training set (normalisation of data is allowed if required). Print the final test accuracy. [5] 4) Report and results. [20]</li>

  </ol></li>

</ul>
